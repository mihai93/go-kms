# Project Skeleton
A go-swagger project skeleton using a TODO list application as sample code.

## Prerequisites
Make sure that you have GoLang and go-swagger installed before proceeding.

Install Go:
https://golang.org/doc/install

Add GOPATH to your path in your `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
export GOPATH="${HOME}/go"
export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin"
```

Install go-swagger:
```bash
brew tap go-swagger/go-swagger
brew install go-swagger
```

## Usage
Remove `.git` and initialize it again for the new repo:
```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
git push -u origin master
```

Modify `swagger.yml` to fit your needs.

NOTE: The following guide will assume `todo-list` is the name of the application. 
Change this to your desired application name.

You can validate your swagger file by either using the [online editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or running:
```bash
swagger validate ./swagger.yml
```

Generate the server:
```bash
swagger generate server -A todo-list -f ./swagger.yml
```

Modify `restapi/configure_todo_list.go` so that it has the logic of your app.

Install the generated app, the name used when generating will have `-server` appended to it:
```bash
go install ./cmd/todo-list-server/
```

And then you can start the server (on a random port):
```bash
todo-list-server
```

You can see a list of options with:
```bash
todo-list-server --help
```

### Cleaning up
Run the following command to remove all the files and folders generated by swagger:
```bash
make clean
```
